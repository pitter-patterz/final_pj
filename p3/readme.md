# Introduction

In this part, we train a VIT on CIFAR-100 dataset to do image classfication. The steps are as follows.

+ Download the dataset and unzip the file.

+ Transform the type of data via *change_format.py*.

+ Run train.py to train your VIT. Remember to set the argument --data-path and --weights (if you have downloaded pretrained weights).

+ Run predict.py to test the model.

Our trained VIT (accuracy=66.62) can be downloaded from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Jl7Afbr-GDblsmgrd5dAMw (pwd:rjjb).
