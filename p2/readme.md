We train three different Faster-RCNNs on VOC dataset.

** Initialize the backbone net (VGG16) with random parameters.
** Use the VGG16 pretrained on ImageNet.
** Use the mask-RCNN trained on coco.

The implementation of method 1,2 is based on our *project2-2*, see https://github.com/pitter-patterz/pj2-2.
